<h1>Create Wallet</h1>
A wallet can be created in a number of ways:
<ul>
    <li>New Address</li>
    <li>Recover from Seed</li>
    <li>Recover from Keys</li>
    <li>View Only</li>
</ul>
In all cases you need to name your wallet and give it a password. The password is used for
securing your wallet data on the device. Use a strong password - better a passphrase.

<h2>New Address</h2>
You need a new Monero Address.<br/>
No need to enter additional info.

<h2>Recover from Seed</h2>
You already have a Monero Address and want to recover the transactions from the blockchain.<br/>
Enter your Seed in the field "Mnemonic Seed". If you know the block number of the first
transaction used for this address, enter it in the field "Restore Height" - leaving in blank will
scan the <em>entire</em> blockchain for transactions belonging to your address.
This takes a <em>long</em> time.

<h2>Recover from Keys</h2>
Instead of recovering from the mnemonic seed, you can recover using your keys.<br/>
Enter your Monero Address in the field "Public Address" and fill out "View Key", "Spend Key"
and optionally "Restore Height" with the appropriate values.

<h2>View Only</h2>
You just want to monitor incoming transactions to a wallet.<br/>
Enter your Monero Address in the field "Public Address" and fill out the "View Key" and
optionally "Restore Height" with the appropriate values leaving the "Spend Key" blank.
